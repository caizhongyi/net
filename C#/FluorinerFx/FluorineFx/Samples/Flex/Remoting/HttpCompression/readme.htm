<h2>HttpCompression</h2>

<p>Demonstrates how to configure http compression for remoting calls (amf channel only).</p>

<p>It is recommend compressing the amf streams only in the case of very large datasets. Please note that the additional cpu cycles required to compress the data may slow down the response time. The data should be highly compressible so a greater reduction in size can be achieved.</p>
<p>Check your log file for the compression ratio.</p>
