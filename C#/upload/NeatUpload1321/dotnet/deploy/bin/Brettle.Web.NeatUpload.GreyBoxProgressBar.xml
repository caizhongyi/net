            <summary>
            Displays progress and status of an upload using a GreyBox pop-up window.</summary>
            <remarks>
            For the progress bar to be displayed, the <see cref="T:Brettle.Web.NeatUpload.UploadHttpModule"/> must be in use.
            For the progress display to be started, the form being submitted must include an <see cref="T:Brettle.Web.NeatUpload.InputFile"/>
            control that is not empty.  If you use the <see cref="!:Triggers"/> property (or the <see cref="!:AddTrigger"/> method)
            to specify which controls should cause files to be uploaded, then other controls will not start the progress
            display (e.g. "Cancel" buttons).

            URL of the directory containing the GreyBox support files.</summary>
            <remarks>
            The URL should not include a the trailing "/".
            You may use an absolute or relative URL that refers to a page in the same web application.  If the URL
            starts with "~", the "~" will be replaced with the web application root as returned by
            <see cref="P:System.Web.HttpRequest.ApplicationPath"/>.  By default, "~/greybox" will be used.</remarks>
