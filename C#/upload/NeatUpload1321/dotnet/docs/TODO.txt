Remove MultiFile async files if no request are received for some time (e.g. 60 secs).
	This will need to wait until web client-service access to the session is available, because the timer
	callback can't safely reference the worker request associated with the original request.

Support FileAdded handlers that takes the file object (with a Delete() function) as a parameter and returns 
a handler to be called when the file is deleted.  Those handlers would be used to update the file list.
Support Init handler which could be used to add the FileAdded handler as well as the element(s) for displaying
the file list?
Add DeleteAll() function which just calls Delete() on all the files.
Support FlashLoaded handler that could show extra text like "Use Shift-click or Cntrl-click to select multiple file". 


Allow per-file progress to be displayed when Flash is being used.
